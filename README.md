# Covid-19-Outcome-Prediction
This is a team project done by 2: Maryam Mohamed and myself. This is an application on supervised learning models using libraries as Numpy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn. The data used in this project will help to identify whether a person is going to recover from coronavirus symptoms or not based on some pre-defined standard symptoms. These symptoms are based on guidelines given by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The data.csv dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus.
